# Animal-Competition-DGRM
We will have a large amount of animals (around 50) which will be categorized by features and size (little mammals, big birds, little amphibians) each class will have a different number for their Intelligence, Power, Defense,  Mobility, Health, Stealth, Stamina,  Intimidation, and Resolve. Players will be given a list of the stats above and get to choose their favourite this will raise the stat they choose and lower a different one. (The player could take a guess) Then the program will add up the stats and display the winner. (add environments)
